# 100. Same Tree
# Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.
# Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

# Example 1:
# Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
# Output: true

# Example 2:
# Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
# Output: false

# Example 3:
# Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
# Output: false

# Constraints:
# The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 100].
# -104 <= Node.val <= 104

# Definition for a binary tree node.

    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
